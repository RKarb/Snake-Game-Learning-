Snake Game work in progress made in Unity with C#

Snake Game is a work-in-progress test environment created in order to experiment with the creation of a top-down snake-like game. The project was created as a testing 
ground for features such as fluid movement and self-made 3D model implementation. In its current state, Snake Game uses only pre-made open source models.
